## Reviews & Draft Responses

### 🔴 URGENT — Negative Review
**Platform:** TripAdvisor
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆
**Review:** "Despite a rich history and some outstanding pub grub in the past, Legends has taken a down-turn in the last 5 years or so. The food has become just average, and the cleanliness is not what it used to be (a stale beer smell permeates the place). On the bright side, they have lots of big screens and show all sorts of sporting events."

**Draft Response:**
> Thanks for taking the time to share your honest feedback — and for being a longtime fan of Legends. You're right that we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard, especially on cleanliness and food quality. We've been making some changes in the kitchen and stepping up our cleaning routines. We'd love for you to come back and see the difference. Mention this review at the bar and your first round is on us. 🏈

### 🟡 MIXED — Mostly Positive With Service Note
**Platform:** TripAdvisor
**Rating:** ★★★★☆
**Review:** "The burgers were very good and cooked perfectly. The salads were also large and very well prepared, The beer was cold and a good selection. The wait staff needs to eliminate the table side food auction."

**Draft Response:**
> So glad you enjoyed the burgers and salads — our kitchen takes a lot of pride in getting those right! Great call on the "food auction" — we hear you, and we're working with our team on improving how food gets to the right table. Hope to see you back soon!

### 🟢 POSITIVE
**Platform:** Yelp
**Review:** "I ended up winning and got a T-shirt with a cold Modelo and it was perfect. Such a cool idea and so much fun. There is honestly nothing bad I can say about Legends. After all these years it is still one of the best spots in Long Beach and I will always come back."

**Draft Response:**
> This just made our day! Congrats on the win 🎉 — glad you rocked the T-shirt and the Modelo. It means the world to hear that after all these years, you're still coming back. That's what Legends is all about. See you next time — we'll have another cold one waiting!
